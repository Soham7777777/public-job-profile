I want to become a skilled engineer in computer science while maintaining a balanced life with family and friends. My first priority is always my health. I will not work overtime. I fear losing my creativity in non-technical tasks and facing misaligned goals with the industry. I hold onto my goals, inspirations, and morals. The objective is to develop expertise without being exploited by the corporate work culture.
